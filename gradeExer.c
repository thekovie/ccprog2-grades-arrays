/* Instruction:
   1.  Complete the requirements based on the 
	   comments.
   2. You are allowed to create additional functions
      to support your answer, but these should be
	  called from the required functions below. 
   3. in.txt contains sample inputs for the program,
      while expected.txt contains the expected result 
	  of your program. Please mind the spacing to 
	  facilitate blackbox testing.  It is suggested
	  that you practice using input and output redirection
	  to help you in debugging.  For example, if your 
	  executable file is exer.exe, for input and output
	  redirection, type:
	     exer < in.txt > actual.txt
	  Then, compare your actual.txt with the provided
	  expected.txt to see if the contents are exactly the same.
   4. It is expected that your code will compile and run.
      A non-compiling program will result to a grade of 0 
	  for this activity. This is so that you hone the habit 
      of completing one function/feature/requirement, making 
	  sure it compiles and executes properly prior to proceeding 
      to the next requirement; to prepare you for the hands-on
	  exams and mp expectations too of having a compiling program.
